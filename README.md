## 📌 What You'll Learn

Over 8 weeks, you’ll master key NLP concepts:

- Tokenization, Stop Words, Stemming, Lemmatization
- Part-of-Speech (POS) Tagging
- Bag of Words (BoW), TF-IDF, and Word Embeddings
- Text Classification using Naive Bayes and Logistic Regression
- Sentiment Analysis using real-world datasets
- Visualizing emotional trajectories in narrative text
